Here is my code â€”- LINK.

Below i will explain how I did the test and the experience taking it.

I made the decision to use Java as my language for the algorithm and  later needed to research a little how to make REST API in JAVA. (Resources). 

First I made a function that check if a number is a palindrome. Second a from the x to y numbers and check first if the decimal number if a palindrome, if that the case, check if the binary of the number is a palindrome. If the two conditions are true I added to a Json Object, I count the times this happens in total  and added this information to the Json Object as well. Finally i added 

and return the Json Object. 

The Complexity of my Algorithm is : 




Via curl and POST method i send in a JSON format the values of x and y with will be the minimum and maximum numbers the algorithm will search palindromes. 

-> Code
-> Image

It is returned to me in a JSON format the Total Number of Palindromes found. The values of the Palindromes numbers found in Decimal and Binary format and the total cycles needed. 
-> Image 


##Feedback on test: 
I code this mostly on nights but I feel this test was very fun and kind of challenge because i needed to pick up pieces of information i didn't remembered very well (POST, CURL , Algorithm Complexity ) and put it all together to get something kind of working in a short period of time.

ANEXO 1 
-------

I use some Java Functions, so in order to know What the complexity of my algorithm was i needed first to check complexity for this java Functions. 

The two Java Functions  code and  their complexity is listed below:
